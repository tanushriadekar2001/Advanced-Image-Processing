# Advanced-Image-Processing

# Problem Identification:-
	Although MATLAB is an effective image processing software, there are several obstacles to overcome.
	In order to operate efficiently, MATLAB requires a large amount of computer power. Users with low system capabilities may experience problems with performance.
	Because of its complexity, it can be difficult for novices or people with little experience with programming.
	 A steep learning curve necessitates a significant investment of time and energy to master. MATLAB image processing tasks are robust, but their computing demands make them time-consuming.
	The efficiency of the workflow is impacted when operations take longer than intended. The timely display of image processing results is impacted by MATLAB's processing delay. Before viewing and evaluating the results, users must wait a significant amount of time. 


# objective:-
	The aim of this project is to create a web application that is lightweight and fulfills two essential purposes, all while addressing the client's concerns regarding MATLAB's heavyweight nature: 
	  Smooth Image Viewing: Make sure the web application has an easy-to-use feature that lets users upload and view images right from the UI, guaranteeing a simple and intuitive way to view photographs.     
	 Features for Image Processing: Include a variety of image processing methods within the web application so that users can apply critical image modifications, like noise reduction and picture enhancement, to the uploaded images. 
	This frees users from the requirement for resource-intensive tools like MATLAB to edit and enhance the quality of their photographs.
